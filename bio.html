        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Daniel Geyko. I was born in Toronto, Canada, to immigrant parents who raised me with care and taught me to set and achieve goals with high standards for myself.
            I have a younger brother, and growing up together couldn't have been a better experience. I was also a competitive men's gymnast, which helped me develop discipline, attention to detail, and perseverance.
            Currently, Iâ€™m studying Computer Programming and Analysis at Humber College. I enjoy working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build interactive web applications and am always eager to learn new technologies.
            In my free time, I enjoy skiing, rock climbing, and flying drones. My goal is to combine my passion for technology with creativity and, one day, have a family and own a home.
